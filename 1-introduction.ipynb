    "Welcome to Calcul Québec's introduction to machine learning workshop. Please read the following housekeeping items before you scroll down to where the action happens!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this workshop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop and its accompanying material were developed for complete beginners in machine learning, with two main teaching goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gently introduce participants to the fundamentals of machine learning. If you were attending a driving school, this material would cover only the simplest rules of the road like \"Red light means stop, Green light means go\" for example. Don't expect a very deep treatise of the subject here.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Show participants how to do basic machine learning in practice **using Compute Canada's resources specifically.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this workshop isn't:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A rigorous introduction to the mathematics of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A complete overview of programming frameworks for machine larning. Examples will be shown using the Python libraries **scikit-learn** and **PyTorch**.\n",
    "\n"

    "### The workshop will follow the structure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Motivation for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Supervised Learning (scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Supervised Learning (PyTorch) \n",

    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Machine Learning and why is it so popular?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset...\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/some_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the relationship between $Y$ and the $X_n$'s?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why you might want to know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observing or measuring more $X_n$'s is doable. Observing or measuring more $Y$'s is not possible or not practical (perhaps $Y$'s are in the future). You want to *predict* $Y$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Y$'s are the output of a slow process that involves $X_n$'s. You want to *predict* $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Y$'s are the output of a Human decision making process that involves $X_n$'s. You want a computer to do it instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given records of someone's activity online, find out what ads they are most likely to click.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Translating a French sentence to English.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determining whether an object is present on a picture, then identifying where on the picture the object is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identifying genes not present on a gene bank based on a sequence of nucleotide base pairs (Gene Prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diagnosing diseases based on various sources of patient data, like imaging and other exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identifying neural connectivity signatures of mental or behavioural disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can these relationships be **learned** from data? This is the domain of **Supervised Learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now back to our dataset...\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/some_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are there any patterns or structures in this dataset that could be useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why you might want to know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rows might bundle together nicely into discernible groups that are not represented in the dataset by a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There might be a way of *compressing* the dataset so that it encodes approximately the same information using *fewer* variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There may be ways to represent the dataset that clearly encode dependencies groups of variables might have between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are missing values in the dataset, there may be a way to infer plausible values to replace an \"NaN\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grouping customers that have similar buying habits and targeting them with a promotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Matching documents that have similar contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decomposing a signal into its different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating a graphical (as in graphs with nodes and edges) representation of the neural wiring of a specific part of an animal's brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Fill in\" holes in images that have missing chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Infer plausible ratings a person would give to a movie they didn't watch or an item they didn't buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can these structures be **learned** from data? This is the domain of **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following definition of what \"learning\" looks like for a computer, from Mitchell (1997):\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to a class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$ , as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All the examples above are instances of Tasks $T$. As Machine Learning algorithms \"look\" at more data, or acquire more Eperience $E$, the goal is to keep getting better at these tasks $T$, according to some performance measure $P$... at least until a point where we think the program is good enough at $T$ to be useful.\n",
