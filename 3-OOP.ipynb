    "## Quick Introuction to Object Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move to talking about **PyTorch** in the next notebook, we need to introduce the concept of Object Oriented Programming. This way of writing code is key in using **PyTorch** effectively to solve hard Machine Learning problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Object Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly referred to as \"OOP\", it is really just a way of writing code that is different from what we've been doing so far. In the previous notebook, whenever we wanted to perform a computation, like loading data or training a model for example, we simply wrote what we wanted to do by calling functions and assigning results to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, however, functions and variables take the backseat and play second fiddle to another type of entity called **Objects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, **Objects** are pieces of code that *encapsulate* sets of variables and functions inside of a single entity. In OOP jargon, these variables that live inside of an Object are called *attributes*, *fields* or *properties*. The functions that operate on these *properties* are called *methods*. Generally, an OOP program will feature multiple Objects that use methods to interact with one another and make things happen. Objects that have the same attributes and methods are said to belong to the same **Class**. Generally you will use objects of many different classes in a program to get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen examples of **Objects** of different **Classes** in action in the previous notebook. For example, when we fit models to the iris dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lr_model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', multi_class='ovr')\n",
    "\n",
    "lr_model.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first line, we *spawned* or *created an instance of* an Object of the **Class** `LogisticRegression`. We didn't need to ask ourselves what exactly was inside this object, we just knew that it contains all the code necessary to train a Logistic Regression model given some input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it were, on the second line we call the **Method** `fit` to load our training data inside the object and train the model. Later, we used the following lines of code to get information out of the Object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Y_hat = lr_model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "plot_confusion_matrix(lr_model,X_test, Y_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first line we used the **Method** `predict` to load our Test examples inside the Object and have it compute, then output predictions. We then stored the predictions we got back from the `lr_model` object inside a variable called `Y_hat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then on the second line we pass the `lr_model` object **itself** to the function `plot_confusion_matrix` along with our Test Set to see how our model did on the test data. We don't have to know how exactly the function does it, but it has code in it that allows it to interact with objects of the class LogisticRegression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I Define My Own Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to define your own Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write your own Class from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take advantage of existing Classes and use them as a template to create your new Class of Objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In option 1, you need to think long and hard about what properties and methods the Objects of your new Class need to have. \n",
    "\n",
    "With option 2, life is easier - templates provide properties and method you can use as is or modify, and you are free to add new ones if need be. In OOP jargon, this concept of using Class templates is called **inheritance**. Very literally, your new Class will *inherit* properties and methods from its **parent class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see on the next notebook, being able to define your own objects plays a big part in using **PyTorch** effectively. Luckily, all the Class writing you will need to do is of the *inheritance* type. Let's see what that looks like in practice in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class *Your Class Name*(*Parent Class Name*):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, *input attributes*):\n",
    "    super().__init__(self, *parent Class attributes*) # Load attributes and methods from the parent Class\n",
    "    self.*attribute name* = *value*\n",
    "    self.*attribute name* = *value*\n",
    "\n",
    "  def *method name*(self, *arguments*):\n",
    "    *work happens here*\n",
    "    *use self. to access attributes defined above*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
